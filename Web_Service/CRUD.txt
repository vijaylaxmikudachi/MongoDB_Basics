CRUD::

The core operations in any RESTful API are tied to the 
fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions, 
which are mapped to specific HTTP methods. 
These operations allow a client to interact with resources (like database entries) on the server. 

1. CREATE (POST)
HTTP Method: POST
Purpose: To create a new resource on the server.
Request Format: The client sends data in the request body (usually in JSON format) that represents the new resource 
                to be created.

Non-idempotent: Sending the same POST request multiple times may result in creating duplicate resources.
Use Case: Adding new items (e.g., registering a user, creating a new blog post).

2. READ (GET)
HTTP Method: GET
Purpose: To retrieve or read data from the server. This is a safe and idempotent method, 
         meaning no data on the server is modified.

Safe and Idempotent: No changes are made to the server, and repeated requests will return the same response.
Use Case: Viewing details (e.g., viewing a product list, getting user profile information).

3.UPDATE (PUT)
HTTP Method: PUT
Purpose: To update an existing resource on the server. This method typically replaces the entire resource with new data.

Idempotent: Sending the same PUT request multiple times will result in the same state on the server. 
            Each subsequent PUT request with the same data does not change the state after the first one.
Use Case: Updating an entire resource (e.g., editing a userâ€™s profile, replacing product information).

4. UPDATE (Partial) - PATCH
HTTP Method: PATCH
Purpose: To partially update an existing resource. 
         Instead of replacing the whole resource, PATCH modifies only the fields that are provided in the request body.

Idempotent: Like PUT, sending the same PATCH request multiple times will result in the same state on the server.
Use Case: Updating only certain fields of a resource 
          (e.g., changing a user's email, updating the stock count of a product).

5. DELETE (DELETE)
HTTP Method: DELETE
Purpose: To delete a resource from the server.

Idempotent: Sending the same DELETE request multiple times has the same effect. 
            Once the resource is deleted, further DELETE requests will have no effect.
Use Case: Removing resources (e.g., deleting a user account, removing a product from the catalog).
